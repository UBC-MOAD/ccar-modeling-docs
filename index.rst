This is a collection of documentation about the CCAR Modeling Project.  
It is mostly focused on the UBC modeling component of the GEOTRACES project.

About the Project
=================

The Arctic Ocean as one of the major ocean basins in the high latitudes, is strongly affected by the climate change. 
The continuous warming trend since 1970s has resulted in significant sea-ice melt, 
affecting the hydrological cycle and potentially leading to the state of a "new Arctic". 
At present, due to the limited understanding of the climate-induced changes in high latitudes, 
Arctic-GEOTRACES Project, under the support of Climate Change and Atmospheric Research (CCAR), 
provides an opportunity to investigate the interaction of the physical and biogeochemical processes in the Arctic Ocean
from the prospect of Trace Elements and Isotopes (TEIs).


The CCAR modeling team is developing a set of parameterizations under the architecture of NEMO_ 3.4 
to simulate TEIs offline in the Arctic Ocean and incorporate the result with observations 
from the two back-to-back GEOTRACES cruises in the Canadian side of the Arctic and the Labrador Sea. 
The modeling efforts is aiming to produce refined estimates of the current state of the TEIs 
and examine its linkage with other factors in the climate system
