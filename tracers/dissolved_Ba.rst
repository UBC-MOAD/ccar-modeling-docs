Dissolved Barium
*****************

Biogeochemical Properties
=========================

Dissolved Barium is a type of bio-intermediate element which in general behaves like hard-part
nutrients [Chan et al., 1977, Falkner et al., 1993].

Dissolved Barium was first posed as a tracer of Arctic river and halocline water by Falkner et al.
[1994]. Then the on-going field measurements in Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, Laptev Sea and Eurasian
marginal seas found that North American rivers like Yukon and Mackenzie have dissolved Barium
concentration significantly higher than major Eurasian rivers. Therefore, dissolved Barium is able to
separate North American runoff from Eurasian runoff. [Guay, 1997, Guay and Falkner, 1997, 1998,
Taylor et al., 2003]. Since the ※background§ surface dissolved Barium level in the Arctic Ocean is
lower than both Eurasian and North American runoff, dissolved Barium also acts as a proxy of Arctic
runoff water in general [Falkner et al., 1994].
